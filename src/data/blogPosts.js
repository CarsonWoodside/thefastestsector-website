      <p>The Spanish Grand Prix has always been a crucial test of car performance, and this year's race promises to be no different. With Lando Norris showing incredible form this season, all eyes will be on whether anyone can challenge the McLaren driver's dominance.</p>

      <h2>The McLaren Advantage</h2>
      <p>McLaren's recent upgrades have transformed their car into a championship contender. The new floor design, introduced at Miami, has given them a significant edge in high-speed corners - exactly what Catalunya demands.</p>
      <h3>Key Statistics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Norris wins in 2025:</strong> 4 out of 8 races</li>
        <li><strong>Pole positions:</strong> 5</li>
        <li><strong>Championship lead:</strong> 47 points</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The technical improvements are clear when comparing the current MCL39 to the season opener. The revised sidepods and floor have unlocked significant downforce without compromising straight-line speed.</p>
      <h2>The Competition</h2>
      <p>While Norris leads the championship, several drivers remain in contention. Charles Leclerc's recent form suggests Ferrari has found their sweet spot, while Max Verstappen can never be counted out despite Red Bull's struggles.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Catalunya has always been about finding the perfect balance between downforce and drag. This year, McLaren seems to have cracked that code."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Race Prediction</h2>
      <p>Expect another commanding performance from Norris, but don't sleep on the midfield battle. Alpine and Aston Martin have both brought significant upgrades that could shake up the order.</p>
      <p>Weather could play a factor with scattered showers predicted for Sunday afternoon. If rain arrives, it could level the playing field and provide opportunities for strategic brilliance.</p>
